    <div>
      <p>Hello, my name is Gokul, and I am 20 years old as of 2021. 
        I hope to graduate RVCC soon, I am saying this because when I started RVCC when I was about 18 years old I was born on March 24th, 2001. 
        I was born in Fremont California later moved to Aurora Illinois thats where my childhood and my middle school years took place. 
        after that I moved to Bridgewater New Jersey for my high school and college and that’s where I had most of the experiences that shaped me into who I am today. 
        My family lives in states such as California, Arizona, Texas, and maybe even Washington state. 
        I am happy enough to be finishing this semester in RVCC and hope to end this year well with good grades. 
        I am an IT major, and I also find it interesting to be coding, 
        but I found this easier to do and my friends and family were recommending 
        I did this course in RVCC because you could go just about anywhere in the world with computer science 
        compared to automobile engineering where you only work with cars

          <h2>Article On Hover Effect:</h2>
          <article>
          <br>
            In this short essay I am going to discuss what is an image hover effect, how its used and how to create one.
          </br>
          <br>
            First, An hover effect is used to effect the graphical interface component response when the mouse hovers over it. I chose This
            topic because its interesting how an hover is created and how its used. 
            The response can be either a form of motion or a change in appearence. The effects are used to highlight important detail.
            Elements on the web page can improve the site interactivity. Hover Effects can can keep the visitors engaged an compelled 
            and can even be helpful by making them spend more time on your website. You can also make the users experience by guiding them what to do next.
        </br>
        
            <br>
            Second, an hover effect is created by containing the image and overlaying the div content to overlay the image here are the steps:
            1. Creating a markup page: We’ll start with a plain unordered list which will represent a typical page menu. 
            Each menu link will include two span elements. 
            The first span will contain the anchor text, while the second one will hold a Font Awesome icon
            2. Specify the Styles: The list will be a flex container with horizontally centered content 
            The first span in each item will have some padding around it:
            Then the second span will be absolutely positioned and hidden by default. Plus, its icon will be horizontally and vertically centered:
            3. Revealing Swipe CSS Hover Effect: In this second example, we’ll continue with another hover effect where text is replaced by a Font Awesome icon. 
            But, this time, the replacement will happen in the background and won’t be visible to us, thanks to a “swipe” that happens in the foreground.
            These were some of the examples on how to code to get the hpver effect.
            </br>
            <br>
            Third, a good example of how this is suppose to work is the following code 
            (this is the CSS to make this work to make this work): 
          </br>
          <br>
         
        .container {
        position: relative;
        width: 50%;
        }
        
        .image {
        display: block;
        width: 100%;
        height: auto;
        }
        
        .overlay {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        bottom: 0;
        left: 0;
        right: 0;
        height: 100%;
        width: 100%;
        opacity: 0;
        transition: .5s ease;
        background-color: #008CBA;
        }
        
        .container:hover .overlay {
        opacity: 1;
        }
        
        .text {
        color: white;
        font-size: 20px;
        position: absolute;
        top: 50%;
        left: 50%;
        -webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        text-align: center;
        }
        Finally, I am going to show the how I wrote the code for the hover effect here it is shown below:
        .container:hover .image {
        opacity: 0.3;
        }
        
        .container:hover .middle {
        opacity: 1;
        }
        
        .text {
        background-color: #04AA6D;
        color: white;
        font-size: 16px;
        padding: 16px 32px;
        }
        .Gallery:hover {
        opacity: 0.7;
        }
